## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the server, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- MongoDB (or MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd blog-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will start running at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use any HTTP client (e.g., cURL, Postman) to interact with the API endpoints. Refer to the [Endpoints](#endpoints) section below for a list of available endpoints and their descriptions.

## Endpoints

- `GET /posts`: Get all blog posts
- `GET /posts/:postId`: Get a specific blog post by ID
- `POST /posts`: Create a new blog post
- `PUT /posts/:postId`: Update a blog post by ID
- `DELETE /posts/:postId`: Delete a blog post by ID
- `GET /posts/:postId/comments`: Get all comments for a specific blog post
- `POST /posts/:postId/comments`: Add a new comment to a blog post
- `PUT /posts/:postId/comments/:commentId`: Update a comment on a blog post
- `DELETE /posts/:postId/comments/:commentId`: Delete a comment on a blog post

For detailed descriptions and examples of request and response formats, refer to the API documentation or Swagger UI (if available).

## Authentication

(Optional) If user authentication is enabled, you may need to obtain an access token by authenticating with the API using your credentials. Include the access token in the request headers for endpoints that require authentication.
